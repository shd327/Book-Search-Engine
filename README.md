# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

This project was leveraging google API search engine built with REST API. I refactor the code to be a GraphQL application build with Apollo Server. This application utilized MERN stack, React for the front end and MongoDB for the database, and Express server.


## User Story

```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```
